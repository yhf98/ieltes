        <h3>The life of Beatrix Potter</h3>
        <p style="font-style: italic">
          The children’s author and illustrator who created Peter Rabbit
        </p>
        <p>
          Beatrix Potter is one of the best-selling children’s authors of all
          time. Her popular series of books that includes The Tale of Peter
          Rabbit was first published over one hundred years ago and has never
          been out of print. Generations of children have enjoyed her many
          stories and illustrations, all of which celebrate the English way of
          life and rural landscape through the adventures of animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Born into a comfortable middle-class family in London in 1866, Potter
          spent much of her early life in her own company. She was educated at
          home by a governess and rarely saw her brother, Bertram, who was sent
          to boarding school. Having little social contact with children of her
          own age, Potter was drawn into a private world of writing. When she
          was 15, she began to keep a diary written in a secret code of her own
          invention. Even Beatrix herself, when she read back over it in later
          life, found it difficult to understand. It was not until 15 years
          after her death that the code was cracked. To the outside world
          Beatrix seemed shy and reserved, but in her diary she expressed
          herself freely and was critical of the work of several contemporary
          artists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Potter was a naturally gifted artist, and with the aid of some art
          lessons she also learned the technical side of drawing. Throughout her
          childhood she looked after many animals—rabbits, frogs and even
          bats—and sketched them constantly, gradually improving her work by
          sketching in museums. She was also interested in natural history. She
          would spend many hours drawing wildlife such as fungi and flowers, and
          at one time she had an ambition to develop this scientific interest.
          An uncle tried to help her enrol at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew
          in London, but she was rejected because of her gender. Nevertheless,
          she won respect from the scientific establishment for her
          illustrations and her contribution to mycology, the study of fungi.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Potter was in her early twenties, her parents tried to arrange a
          husband for her. Many suitable suitors were found; however, Potter
          turned them all down. Fiercely independent, she disliked the idea of
          being tied to a domestic life that, at that time, consisted mostly of
          staying at home and raising children. Thus—unusually for British women
          of the period—she remained single and lived in her parents’ home.
        </p>
        <p>
          For several years Potter tried to get her first children’s book, The
          Tale of Peter Rabbit, published. Her initial attempts were
          unsuccessful, but she persevered, and eventually Frederick Warne & Co.
          accepted the book. It was finally published in 1902, when Potter was
          36, though the publishers did not expect it to sell many copies. The
          project was given to the youngest brother in the firm, Norman Warne,
          as his first assignment—essentially a test. Luckily, he warmed to both
          the book and its author. Determined to make it a success, he worked
          closely with Potter, poring over every detail. It was Norman who
          insisted that each illustration should be in colour, while Potter
          insisted the book remain small enough for children to hold easily. By
          the end of the year, 28,000 copies were in print.
        </p>
        <p>
          The relationship between Warne and Potter blossomed, and they
          eventually became engaged. However, Potter’s parents disapproved
          because of his occupation. They relented only on condition that the
          couple live apart for six months to give Potter time to reconsider.
          Tragically, before the wedding could take place, Warne developed
          pernicious anaemia, a blood disease, and passed away. Potter was
          devastated and wrote to his sister, Millie, “He did not live long, but
          he fulfilled a useful, happy life. I must try to make a fresh
          beginning next year.”
        </p>
        <p>
          After Warne’s death, Potter moved to the Lake District in northern
          England. In 1905 she bought a small farm there, and for the next eight
          years she busied herself writing more books, some set in or around the
          area. She remained there for the rest of her life, but failing
          eyesight eventually forced her to stop writing children’s books.
          Instead, she devoted herself to breeding sheep and helping to conserve
          farms in the district. Thanks to the proceeds from her successful
          books and a later inheritance, Potter was able to buy many working
          farms. On her death she left more than 4,000 acres to the National
          Trust, an organisation that protects historic buildings and
          countryside in England. As a result, her beloved landscape is now
          accessible to countless visitors.
